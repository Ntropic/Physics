# Newton Simulator
## Calculate trajectories of Newtonian many body systems.

## Warning: This was my first larg programming project, from long before I even studied physics.
As a result, the code is not well organized, with the main file, being 8000 lines, that should have been separated into multiple files. I keep it here for sentimental reasons, as I learned a lot about what not to do, during this project.
As an example, I programmed my own plotting software
I had no idea about differential equations, or how to solve them, and therefor the code runs with what is effectively an Euler method, limiting the speed of the computations.

### How To: 
Just start *Newton_Simulator_Gui.py* in **python3**, an interface will open up, which will allow you to set the parameters, create many-body systems and then run the simulation.
