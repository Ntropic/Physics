# Photonic Crystal Bandstructures in 2D
## Creates the Photonic Bandstructures of 2D photonic crystals (with interactive field preview)

The TE and TM bandstructures can be previewed with the programs *TE_plane_wave_expansion_method_2d.m* and *TM_plane_wave_expansion_method_2d.m*.

TE Band strcutre of a 2D hexagonal photonic crystal. With the mouse one can hover over the Bands, to preview the field distribution of the closest point on a band, see below. Clicking on a band will increase the resolution of the field distribution (this will take a while).

The TE & TM bandstructures can be viewed together via the script *TEM_plane_wave_expansion_method_2d.m*, this will not give a preview of the field distributions, but add Grayshading to show the lightcone, of states that can be excited from outside the crystal.

The previous bandstructures plotted a triangle path through the hexagonal reciprocal lattice.
